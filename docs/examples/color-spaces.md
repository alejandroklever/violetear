# Visualizing color spaces

In this example we'll play around with all the functionality in the [`violetear.color`](/violetear/api/violetear.color/) namespace. For this purpose we'll build several color palettes. You can check the basic markup [here](color-spaces.html) and the final CSS file [here](color-spaces.css).

We'll start with some pretty basic CSS to give some margin and padding to the document body.
We'll also write a style for `.palette` elements to make them align their children in a flexible row, because we will be using lots of palettes in this examples.

```python title="color_spaces.py"
from violetear import StyleSheet

sheet = StyleSheet(normalize=True)
sheet.select('body').width(max=768).margin('auto', top=50).padding(10)
sheet.select(".palette").flexbox().children("div").flex(1).height(50).margin(5)

# ... (1)

sheet.render("color-spaces.css")
```

1. As usual, all our rules will go in here.

## Basic colors

We'll start with the four basic colors: red, green, blue, and gray. For each of these, we have a method in `violetear.color` that let us get any point in the lightning gradient.

To illustrate this, let's create a palette for each of the basic colors. In the HTML markup you'll notice we have something like this:

```html title="color-spaces.html"
<body>
    <h1>Basic colors</h1>
    <div id="basic-colors">
        <div class="red palette">
            <div class="shade-0"></div>
            <!-- ... -->
            <div class="shade-10"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="green palette">
            <div class="shade-0"></div>
            <!-- ... -->
            <div class="shade-10"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="blue palette">
            <div class="shade-0"></div>
            <!-- ... -->
            <div class="shade-10"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="gray palette">
            <div class="shade-0"></div>
            <!-- ... -->
            <div class="shade-10"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!-- ... -->
</body>
```

Thus, we will style each of those `.shade-{i}` elements according to their parent class and their shade fraction. For example, the element `.shade-4` inside the `.red` palette will be background colored with `red(0.4)`. And the best part is we'll do all of this in four lines of code (plus one import):

```python title="color_spaces.py" hl_lines="2 7 8 10 11"
from violetear import StyleSheet
from violetear.color import red, green, blue, gray

# ... (1)

# Basic colors
for cls, color in zip(['.red', '.green', '.blue', '.gray'], [red, green, blue, gray]):
    palette = sheet.select(cls)

    for i in range(11):
        palette.children(f'.shade-{i}').background(color(i/10)).border(0.1, gray())

sheet.render("color-spaces.css")
```

VoilÃ¡! Just like that we created 40 different CSS styles. If you look at the file CSS file you'll notice a bunch of rules like:

```css title="color-spaces.css"
.red>.shade-0 {
    background-color: rgba(0,0,0,1.0);
}

.red>.shade-1 {
    background-color: rgba(51,0,0,1.0);
}

.red>.shade-2 {
    background-color: rgba(102,0,0,1.0);
}

/* ... */

.red>.shade-9 {
    background-color: rgba(254,204,204,1.0);
}

.red>.shade-10 {
    background-color: rgba(255,255,255,1.0);
}

/* ... */
```

## CSS colors

If you need more colors, the `Colors` class contains definitions for all CSS colors, which can be accessed either by name or by dot notation.

As an example, let's style the 16 basic CSS colors explicitly.

```python title="color_spaces.py"
# ... (1)

basic_colors = [
    Colors.White,
    Colors.Silver,
    Colors.Gray,
    Colors.Black,
    Colors.Red,
    Colors.Maroon,
    Colors.Yellow,
    Colors.Olive,
    Colors.Lime,
    Colors.Green,
    Colors.Aqua,
    Colors.Teal,
    Colors.Blue,
    Colors.Navy,
    Colors.Fuchsia,
    Colors.Purple,
]

for i, color in enumerate(basic_colors):
    sheet.select(".basic").children('div', nth=i+1).background(color).border(0.1, gray())

# ... (2)
```

1. Rest of the script hidden for simplicity.
2. Rest of the script hidden for simplicity.

However, explicitely listing colors is so boring, that `Colors` provides several methods for enumerating common palettes. So the same can be achieved with:

```python title="color_spaces.py"
# ... (1)

for i, color in enumerate(Colors.basic_palette()):
    sheet.select(".basic").children("div", nth=i + 1).background(color).border(0.1, gray())

# ... (2)
```

1. Rest of the script hidden for simplicity.
2. Rest of the script hidden for simplicity.

Now let's do the same but with all the CSS palettes. The method `Colors.palette()` returns a palette by name. For each palette, there's also an explicit method for it. So you can either use `Colors.red_palette()` or `Colors.palette("red")`.

```python title="color_spaces.py"
# ... (1)

for palette in ['pink', 'red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'brown', 'green', 'cyan', 'blue', 'purple', 'white', 'black']:
    for i, color in enumerate(Colors.palette(palette)):
        sheet.select(f".{palette}-colors").children('div', nth=i+1).background(color).border(0.1, gray(0.4))

# ... (2)
```

1. Rest of the script hidden for simplicity.
2. Rest of the script hidden for simplicity.

??? question "Why so many options?"
    At this point you may be asking why do we need both dot notation and dictionary notation to access names. For example, you can use:

    ```python
    color = Colors.SlateBlue
    # or
    color = Colors['SlateBlue']
    ```

    Same with palettes, you can access them by name and by dot notation.

    The reason is simple: both forms are useful, and `violetear` tries to be non-opinionated.
    When you're explicitly defining a style, writing Python code, you probably prefer the dot notation, because you'll have intellisense, code completion, documentation, etc.

    However, if you're designing a style programatically, using some sort of user input (e.g., you want the user to pick a palette in a combobox), then you'll prefer the dictionary notation. Otherwise you'd have to use lots of `getattr` (which is actually what's happening deep down).
