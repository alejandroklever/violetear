# User Guide

This is a step-by-step guide to using `violetear`. In this guide, we will build a sample website. You can see the sample website alive [here](example.html) and the final source code [here](https://github.com/apiad/violetear/tree/main/docs/example.html).

Before starting, make sure to have `violetear` installed:

```bash
pip install violetear # (1)
```

1. This will install the latest version with `pip`.
   You can install a custom version with `pip install violetear==<version>`.


## Basic setup

We'll start by creating a blank HTML file with a basic markup:

```html title="example.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Example Web Page - violetear</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

Go ahead and paste that into a new file [`example.html`](example.html) and hit the save button!

Next, we'll create a new file [`styles.py`](styles.py) where we will define all our styles. Start by importing the `StyleSheet` class and creating an instance. We'll pass `normalize=True` to ask `violetear` to generate an initial set of CSS rules that normalize styles across modern browsers (taken from [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize)).

```python title="styles.py"
from violetear import StyleSheet

sheet = StyleSheet(normalize=True)

# ... (1)

sheet.render("styles.css")
```

1. Code for each of the styles goes in here.

Run the file `styles.py` and verify that it creates a [`styles.css`](styles.css) file. If you open it you should see a short preamble followed by the normalization rules:

```css title="styles.css"
/* Made with violetear */
/* Generating all 0 styles */
/* Autogenerated on 2022-08-17 22:44:26.345293 */

/*! modern-normalize v1.1.0 ... */
/* (1) */
```

1. The rest of the CSS rules will follow.

Now go ahead and add the style link to your HTML:

```html title="example.html" hl_lines="4"
...
<head>
   <!-- (1) -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
...
```

1. The rest of the header we already saw.

Now we're ready to start adding some markup and styles.

## Simple styling

Let's start by adding some content: a title, a subtitle, and some paragraphs (in latin!):

```html title="example.html"
...
<body>
    <h1>An important lesson</h1>
    <h2>Given by some important guy...</h2>
    <p>
        Sint nesciunt architecto ipsam quia.
        Deleniti explicabo fuga velit.
        Iste occaecati sunt veniam veniam quas ratione nihil.
        Velit nam eum in a nam ratione.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aut quo culpa alias voluptates voluptatem debitis et aperiam.
        Et illo qui quae.
        Alias aut repellat quidem et cum aut.
        Repudiandae doloribus vero quibusdam veniam nam in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Voluptas ut rerum aut harum libero.
        Qui sint et sapiente non fugiat soluta commodi.
        Deserunt ipsum quo autem.
        Inventore in et dolorem.
        Enim nobis in quia quisquam dolorem similique eos.
        Repellat eum consequatur sunt velit eum earum hic tenetur.
    </p>
</body>
```

If you open the `example.html` file right you'll see it's just some unstyled text. So let's add some color.

First, let's make those borders narrower by constraining the width of the `body` tag:

```python title="styles.py"
# ... after sheet = StyleSheet(...)

sheet.select('body').width(0.8, max=768).margin("auto", top=50)

# ... before sheet.render(...)
```

Go ahead and run `styles.py` before reloading the page and you'll see that now we have some nice responsive margins with a maximum width. Try resizing the browser window to see the effect.

Let's break down that one-liner to see what's happening in slow-motion:

- `sheet.select(...)` defines a new blank style. The `select` method receives a CSS selector, in this case, it's the simplest possible selector (`"body"`) but you can use id (e.g., `"#title"`), classes (e.g., `".btn"`) and states (e.g., `":hover"`). The method returns and instance of the `Style` class which lets you chain methods to add the actual CSS rules.
- `.width(...)` defines the rules for the width of the element. In this case we're setting the width to 80% of the parent width, but with a maximum of 768 pixels. As a general idea, anytime you have a set of related attributes in CSS (e.g., `width`, `min-width`, and `max-width`), you'll have a single method in `violetear` that let's you set several of those related attributes in a single call.
- `.margin(...)` defines the overall margin (`auto`) plus a specific value for the top margin of 50 pixels. All methods in `violetear` that take numerical units can receive an instance of the `Unit` class, which can represent pixels, percentages, em, rem, points, etc. For simplicity, plain ints and floats are converted to a sensible unit (e.g., floats are treated as percentages in the case of box geometry, but as rem in the case of font sizes). Later on we'll see how to use `Unit` explicitely.

As a fine tweak, let's soften the colors a little bit. For this purpose, we can define custom styles for the tags`<h1>`. `<h2>` and `<p>`, but that would be kinda repetitive. So instead, we'll define a *base style* in the `StyleSheet` constructor that all styles will inherit. We will need to import `Style` and `Color` to create a base style, and rewrite our constructor call:

```python  title="styles.py"
from violetear import StyleSheet, Style, Color

base_style = Style().color(Color.gray(0.3))
sheet = StyleSheet(normalize=True, base=base_style)

# ... (1)
```

1. Here are all the rules.

`Color.gray(...)` defines a new color using a gray tone with a given luminosity, such that `0` is black and `1` is white. Similarly, you'll find `red`, `green` and `blue` methods to create colors for every luminosity value. More about colors follows [further down](#playing-with-colors) in this guide.

## Creating styles programmatically

Finally, let's change the all the fonts to some custom values. For this purpose we will first create a sequence of sizes using `Unit.scale`, and then programatically create the three styles with a simple `for` loop.

```python title="example.py" hl_lines="1 8 9"
from violetear import StyleSheet, Style, Color, Unit, rem

base_style = Style().color(Color.gray(0.3))
sheet = StyleSheet(normalize=True, base=base_style)

sheet.select("body").width(0.8, max=768).margin("auto", top=50)

for i, size in enumerate(Unit.scale(rem, 1, 2.25, 3)):
    sheet.select(f".size-{i}").font(size, weight=300)

sheet.render("styles.css")
```

Now take a look at the `styles.css` file and you'll notice the new styles at the end:

```css title="styles.css"
/* (1) */

.size-0 {
    color: rgba(76,76,76,1);
    font-size: 1rem;
    font-weight: 300;
}

.size-1 {
    color: rgba(76,76,76,1);
    font-size: 1.625rem;
    font-weight: 300;
}

.size-2 {
    color: rgba(76,76,76,1);
    font-size: 2.25rem;
    font-weight: 300;
}
```

1. Previous rules are up here.

As you can see, we have quickly defined three very similar styles with different font sizes and a single font weight. Let's break it down:

- `Unit.scale` creates a sequence of equally spaced values in a range. Here we called it with `1` and `2.25` as range, and `3` steps. The first parameter uses the function `rem` to define what specific unit is used. You can check in `violetear.units` to see which other units are available.
- The `enumerate(...)`  functions wraps the `Unit.scale` iterable and returns tuples of `i, size`.
- In the body of the `for` loop we create one style for each size, selecting a class `.size-{i}`, hence we'll end with `.size-0`, `.size-1` and `.size-2`.
- Each style also inherited the `base_style` we defined previously.

To apply these styles, we'll need to modify our `example.html` source to put the right classes in place:

```html title="example.html" hl_lines="3 4 5 8 11"
<!-- (1) -->
<body>
    <h1 class="size-2">An important lesson</h1>
    <h2 class="size-1">Given by some important guy...</h2>
    <p class="size-0">
        <!-- (2) -->
    </p>
    <p class="size-0">
        <!-- (3) -->
    </p>
    <p class="size-0">
        <!-- (4) -->
    </p>
</body>
```

!!! tip "More than just CSS"

    Now you can begin to appreciate the power of using something like `violetear` instead of plain CSS, or even CSS supersets like Sass or Less. Combining a few parameters and loops you can imagine how to create complex design systems with dozens of font sizes, styles, colors, etc.

    Furthermore, `violetear` is completely unopinionated. Do you want to style an existing HTML? Do you want to create a complete semantic design system like Bootstrap? Do you prefer a simple utility system like Tailwind? Since `violetear` is just a thin layer on top of CSS, it doesn't force you into any specific design philosophy. You can even mix and match different designs.

## Playing with colors

Now let's take a taste of `violetear`'s power to create expressive designs with minimum effort.
We will create a color pallete and use it to style a row of `div`s.

Firs the markup, add the following at the end of your `body` tag:

```html title="example.html"
<!-- (1) -->
<body>
    <!-- (2) -->
    <div id="color-pallete">
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
    </div>
</body>
```

Back to our `styles.py` file, let's create a color pallete. The method `Color.pallete` works similarly to `Unit.scale`, but with colors. It accepts start and end colors (here, `red(0.3)` and `blue(0.7)`) and a number of steps, and it outputs a sequence of `Color` objects that equally distributed in color space (you can pass a `space` parameter, `"hsl"`, `"hsv"` or `"rgb"`):

```python title="styles.py" hl_lines="3"
# ... (1)

pallete = Color.pallete(Color.red(0.3), Color.blue(0.7), 10)
root = sheet.select("#color-pallete").flexbox()

for i, color in enumerate(pallete):
    root.children('div', nth=i+1).width(1.0).height(10).margin(0.1).background(color)

sheet.render("styles.css")
```

1. The first part of the script is hidden for simplicity.

Next, we select the container `div` with id `color-pallete` and apply a simple *flexbox* style. This causes that all children `div`s are automatically layout in row. More on the flexbox and other layout options [later on in this guide](#layout-options).

```python title="styles.py" hl_lines="4"
# ... (1)

pallete = Color.pallete(Color.red(0.3), Color.blue(0.7), 10)
root = sheet.select("#color-pallete").flexbox()

for i, color in enumerate(pallete):
    root.children('div', nth=i+1).width(1.0).height(10).margin(0.1).background(color)

sheet.render("styles.css")
```

1. The first part of the script is hidden for simplicity.

And finally, we iteratively style each of the children `div`s with `.children('div', nth=i+1)`.
This method creates and returns a blank style for the selected child(ren) to which you can chain additional styling methods.
Since these `div`s are already layout as flex items, we just need to give them an appropiate width (100% in this case) and height (25 pixels), a minimum margin (`0.1 rem`) and apply one of the colors of the scale.

```python title="styles.py" hl_lines="6 7"
# ... (1)

pallete = Color.pallete(Color.red(0.3), Color.blue(0.7), 10)
root = sheet.select("#color-pallete").flexbox()

for i, color in enumerate(pallete):
    root.children('div', nth=i+1).width(1.0).height(10).margin(0.1).background(color).rounded()

sheet.render("styles.css")
```

1. The first part of the script is hidden for simplicity.

!!! tip "Choose your own style"
    This is yet another example of `violetear`'s unopinionated philosophy. Here we are styling children by the `:nth-child()` selector instead of having to explicitely define classes in the HTML.
    Whether you prefer explicit or implicit is up to your design philosophy, `violetear` will help you either way.
